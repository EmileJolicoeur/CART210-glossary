## HTML5

HTML5 is the latest version of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee as his own personal project in 1991. However, it was only once it’s second iteration (HTML 2.0) was released in 1994 that the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) recommended it as the new standard for the creation of websites. As time went on and updates were made, the language became more sophisticated with its final addition being its compatibility with CSS (Cascading Styles Sheets). After releasing HTML 4.01 in 1998, W3C ceased to add new features to its program and instead focused on the creation of an XML-based version, XHTML, released two years later [^rebah21html5].

However, realizing this new, non-backwards compatible program meant the stagnation of HTML, Apple, Mozilla and Opera joined forces under a new venue, WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) to prove that HTML4’s forms could still be improved and remain backwards compatible. While W3C had previously denied WHATWG’s proposal at first, they soon gained interest, making their own working group to aid in the development of HTML5 in 2007. Unfortunately, both groups had different goals: W3C aimed for a finalized product, while WHATWG expected to continuously work on the program, ensuring it remains as the living standard in our technologically ever-evolving world [^whatwg19html5].
In 2012, W3C pushed HTML5 to become the new standard once more, while WHATWG continued its work on the newly renamed HTML Living Standard [^rebah21html5].

New features arrived with HTML5, such as the canvas feature, which allows the website to display pictures and animations, video and audio support features, and semantic tags (header, article, section, footer, etc.), which are area specific [^meyer22html5].
